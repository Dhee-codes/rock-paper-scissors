## How It Works

1. The player selects **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.  
2. The computer randomly generates its own choice.  
3. The app compares both choices:
   - Rock beats Scissors  
   - Paper beats Rock  
   - Scissors beat Paper  
4. The scoreboard updates after each round.  
5. After 5 rounds, the game session ends and the final result is displayed.  
6. Clicking **Play Again** resets the session for a new game.

## Gameplay & UI

1. **Start a Round:**  
   Click on one of the three choice buttons — Rock, Paper, or Scissors.  

2. **View Results:**  
   - Both the player’s and computer’s choices are displayed as images.  
   - The round result (“You Win!”, “You Lose!”, or “It's a tie!”) appears below the images.  
   - Scores for both player and computer update automatically after each round.  

3. **Rounds:**  
   - Each game session consists of 5 rounds.  
   - After the final round, the game session disappears and the end-game screen appears, showing the final result.  

4. **Play Again:**  
   - Click the **Play Again!** button to reset scores, clear choice images, and restart the game session.
